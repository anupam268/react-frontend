### 2. Component Naming:

When it comes to naming your React components, consistency and clarity are crucial for maintainability. Follow these guidelines:

#### 2.1. **PascalCase for Components:**
   - Use PascalCase (also known as UpperCamelCase) for naming React components. For example:
     ```jsx
     // Good
     const HomePage = () => {
       // component logic
     };
     ```

#### 2.2. **CamelCase for Files:**
   - Save your component files with camelCase, matching the component's name. For instance:
     - `HomePage.js`

#### 2.3. **Avoid Generic Names:**
   - Choose names that reflect the purpose of the component. Avoid generic terms like "Component" or "Container" unless they are truly generic.

#### 2.4. **Consistent Naming Conventions:**
   - Ensure all team members follow the same naming conventions to maintain a cohesive codebase. Establish guidelines for specific types of components, like presentational, container, or higher-order components.

#### 2.5. **Use Descriptive Names:**
   - Opt for descriptive names that convey the component's role or functionality. This makes it easier for team members to understand the purpose of each component.

#### 2.6. **Avoid Acronyms:**
   - Minimize the use of acronyms unless they are widely known and accepted within your team or industry. Clarity should always be a priority.

By adhering to these naming conventions, your codebase becomes more readable, and team members can quickly identify the purpose of each component. This consistency contributes to a smoother collaborative development process.
